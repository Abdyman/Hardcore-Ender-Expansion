Hardcore Ender Expansion
========================

## Source code and asset license

This part will become relevant once the mod's source code is publicly visible.

The project is under the All Rights Reserved license, which means that redistribution is still forbidden. However, I hate licenses so here are some general rules, and some specific cases for what you may want to do with the source.

1. Feel free to fork the project on GitHub. The repository must be publicly visible.
2. You are allowed to study the source code and learn from it, but don't just copy large portions of it into your project.
3. Mod's terms of use apply, thus you cannot redistribute any part of the mod or claim it as your own. Forking is the only exception to source & asset redistribution.

### I want to use part of the mod in my own project

If you find a handy method or even an entire class (such as BlockReplaceHelper), I don't mind if you use it in your project (don't copy everything you see though, that's not how you learn to mod). Giving credit is appreciated, but not required.

Don't forget that you can only use the source code, *not* any of the assets.

### I want to modify something in HEE

It would be best to contact me first, because not everything can be added into the mod and I wouldn't want you to waste your time with a PR that will not get accepted.

When modifying the files, please try to follow my code formatting style. I don't autoformat because Eclipse doesn't let me customize the style exactly the way I want it, and for that reason I also cannot give you any preference file you could import.

I'm also a huge derp and don't really get how most of this Git thing works. Don't do anything big because if there's any problem accepting a PR, it will most likely not be accepted.

### I want to create an addon

Keep in mind that addons depend on the parent mod, but don't contain any part of it - otherwise it's a modification!

You are welcome to create and distribute any addon. If you let me know about it, I might add it to a list of supported addons too. :)

### I want to create a modification

The terms say that you cannot redistribute the mod or modifications of the mod. You can play around with the code if you fork the project, but if you want to distribute it, you need my explicit permission. I haven't been in this situation yet, so if you create a modification, let me know and we'll figure something out.

## Issue & task tracker

This project also contains an issue tracker for the mod, which you should use for ideas, questions and bug reports.

Always provide as much information and details as possible. If you're reporting a bug or a crash, always **provide logs** and conditions under which the bug or crash happened!

Resolved issues will have a resolution in square brackets. Resolutions may be *[DONE]*, *[FIXED]*, *[ACKNOWLEDGED]*, *[ANSWERED]*, *[INVALID]*, *[WILL NOT FIX]* or *[NOT A BUG]*. There may also be a version of HEE in the resolution, for example *[FIXED 1.6]*.
