Hardcore Ender Expansion
========================

This page is an issue & task tracker for the Hardcore Ender Expansion mod for Minecraft.

Users can add an issue, however **always** tag them with one of the **user issue tags**! All invalidly tagged issues will be closed. Admin and status tags are going to be managed by myself.

Always provide as much information in an issue as possible. If it is a bug or crash report, always **provide logs** and conditions under which the bug or crash happened!

Resolved issues will have a resolution in square brackets in their name. Resolutions may be *[fixed]*, *[finished]* or *[works as intended]*.
